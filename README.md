Eighth task of Android's course from Udemy website

The goal here is to get used with drawer layout/navigation view/custom toolbar and fragments 

I tried to following certain patterns as Clean Code Book with meaningful names, list down pattern (as newspapers).
 
# Usage

Copy it and build with Android Studio. 

Enjoy!
